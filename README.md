# TCC Conecta - Frontend Repo
#### Hello! This is the GitHub repo for public and stable release versions of our project's frontend code.

## About the project
TCC Conecta (TC3 for short) is a niche social media made as a final project for a Web Dev technical course at ETEC (a public technical school in the state of São Paulo - Brazil).
TC3's focus is on allowing different teams from technical schools that are in the process of making a final project to search for each other in order to find another group that would be willing to work on a different area of the same project theme, so both teams would end up with a more complete project.
For example: A marketing team agrees to make a project together with a web dev team, so each team would take care of their own area while having a bigger final product.
This way, teams would be able to tackle much harder challenges while not increasing their own workload.
